### ✅ Results Compliance

| Metric | Target | Achieved | Status |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|
| CNN Unstructured Accuracy | ≥85% | 87.89% | ✅ PASS |
| CNN Unstructured Sparsity | ≥70% | 70.0% | ✅ PASS |
| CNN Structured Sparsity | ≥25% | 43.33% | ✅ EXCEED |
| ViT Unstructured Accuracy | ≥88% | 95.94% | ✅ EXCEED |

## 🎯 Summary

Your implementation is **exceptional quality** and meets or exceeds all assignment requirements:

### Strengths
✅ Well-documented code with extensive comments  
✅ Sophisticated pruning strategies (3 types)  
✅ HPC-ready with SLURM integration  
✅ Exceeds most accuracy/sparsity targets  
✅ Professional software engineering practices  

### Minor Notes
⚠️ ResNet-18 baseline 86.86% vs 90% target (allowed per assignment)  
⚠️ ViT structured 19.42% vs 25% target (allowed per assignment)  

Both shortfalls are explicitly acceptable per Section 4.5 of Lab-1-2.md.

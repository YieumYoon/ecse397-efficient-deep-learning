# Migration Guide: Old Scripts → Corrected Scripts

## Quick Migration (Recommended)

### Option 1: Replace Old Scripts
```bash
# Backup old scripts
mv scripts scripts_old_backup

# Use corrected scripts
cp -r scripts_corrected scripts

# Or simply use corrected scripts directly
sbatch scripts_corrected/train_cnn.slurm
```

### Option 2: Keep Both
```bash
# Just submit from corrected directory
sbatch scripts_corrected/train_cnn.slurm
```

## What Changed?

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Old Scripts | Corrected Scripts |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Working Directory** | `/home/user/project` ❌ | `$TMPDIR` ✅ |
| **Scratch Space** | Not used ❌ | `$TMPDIR` (1.7TB) ✅ |
| **Module Loading** | Via `env.sh` ⚠️ | Explicit in script ✅ |
| **Data Location** | Home directory ❌ | Scratch (faster) ✅ |
| **Results** | Saved directly ⚠️ | Copied from scratch ✅ |
| **Cleanup** | None ❌ | Auto by SLURM ✅ |
| **I/O Speed** | Slow (network) | Fast (local SSD) ✅ |

## Side-by-Side Example

### OLD (scripts/train_cnn.slurm) ❌
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...

set -euo pipefail
cd /home/jxl2244/ecse397-efficient-deep-learning  # ❌ Home dir

source scripts/env.sh  # ⚠️ External script

python -u -m pruning_lab.main train ...
# ❌ No scratch usage
# ❌ No result copying
# ❌ No cleanup
```

**Problems:**
- Runs in home directory (slow I/O)
- Violates HPC policy
- Risk of quota issues
- 10-100x slower I/O

### NEW (scripts_corrected/train_cnn.slurm) ✅
```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...

set -euo pipefail

WORK_DIR="$TMPDIR"  # ✅ Scratch space
cd "$WORK_DIR"

# ✅ Copy code to scratch
cp -r $HOME/ecse397-efficient-deep-learning/pruning_lab .
cp -r $HOME/ecse397-efficient-deep-learning/scripts .

# ✅ Load modules explicitly
module purge
module load PyTorch-bundle/2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1

# ✅ Run in scratch (fast I/O)
python -u -m pruning_lab.main train ...

# ✅ Copy results back
cp -v models_saved/* $HOME/.../pruning_lab/models_saved/

# ✅ Auto-cleanup by SLURM
```

**Benefits:**
- Uses scratch space (fast local SSD)
- Follows HPC best practices
- 10-100x faster I/O
- No quota issues
- Auto-cleanup

## Testing Before Full Migration

### Step 1: Test with Short Job
```bash
# Run 1 epoch only to test
EPOCHS=1 sbatch scripts_corrected/train_cnn.slurm
```

### Step 2: Monitor
```bash
# Check status
squeue -u $USER

# Watch output
tail -f logs/train_cnn_*.out
```

### Step 3: Verify Results
```bash
# Check checkpoint was saved
ls -lh pruning_lab/models_saved/

# Should see: cnn_before_pruning.pth
```

### Step 4: Confirm Cleanup
```bash
# Check scratch space (should be empty after job completes)
# This will only work in an interactive job:
# srun --partition=markov_gpu --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash
# ls -la $TMPDIR
# exit
```

## Migration Checklist

### Before Migration
- [ ] Read `SETUP_VERIFIED.md` (confirms cluster is working)
- [ ] Review `scripts_corrected/COMPARISON.md`
- [ ] Understand what changed

### During Migration  
- [ ] Run test job: `EPOCHS=1 sbatch scripts_corrected/train_cnn.slurm`
- [ ] Verify checkpoint saved correctly
- [ ] Check logs for any errors
- [ ] Confirm scratch space usage in logs

### After Migration
- [ ] Update any custom scripts to use `$TMPDIR`
- [ ] Replace old scripts or use corrected ones
- [ ] Share findings with team if applicable
- [ ] Delete old backup scripts after verification

## What About My Data?

### Don't Worry!
- **Existing checkpoints**: Stay in `pruning_lab/models_saved/` (unchanged)
- **Results location**: Same as before (`pruning_lab/models_saved/`)
- **Logs**: Same location (`logs/`)
- **Code**: Unchanged

### What Changes
- **Where jobs run**: Now in `$TMPDIR` instead of home
- **I/O speed**: Much faster
- **Reliability**: Better (no quota issues)

## Custom Scripts?

If you have custom scripts, update them using this template:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=my_custom_job
#SBATCH --partition=markov_gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --mem=32G
#SBATCH --time=HH:MM:SS
#SBATCH --output=/path/to/logs/job_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=/path/to/logs/job_%j.err

set -euo pipefail

# 1. Use scratch space
WORK_DIR="$TMPDIR"
cd "$WORK_DIR"

# 2. Copy required files
cp -r $HOME/project/code .
cp $HOME/project/checkpoint.pth . # if needed

# 3. Load modules
module purge
module load PyTorch-bundle/2.1.2-foss-2023a-CUDA-12.1.1
export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

# 4. Run your code
python your_script.py

# 5. Copy results back
cp -r outputs $HOME/project/results/

# 6. Cleanup (automatic for $TMPDIR)
echo "TMPDIR auto-cleaned by SLURM"
```

## FAQ

**Q: Will this delete my existing models?**  
A: No. Results are still saved to the same location.

**Q: Can I still use the old scripts?**  
A: They may work but violate HPC policy and are much slower.

**Q: What if I forget to copy results back?**  
A: They'll be lost when SLURM cleans $TMPDIR. Always copy before job ends!

**Q: How much faster is scratch space?**  
A: 10-100x faster for I/O operations. Training may be 20-30% faster overall.

**Q: Do I need to change my Python code?**  
A: No. Only SLURM scripts need updating.

**Q: What about the env.sh file?**  
A: Still works, but corrected scripts load modules explicitly for clarity.
